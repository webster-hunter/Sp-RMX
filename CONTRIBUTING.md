## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Check the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- When you open a new bug report, include a clear title and description. Include as much relevant information as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue. Start the title with "Feature Request: " for clarity.
- Clearly describe the feature you want, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main` for your work.
- Create a pull request for your changes. Include relevant information in the description of the pull request.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

### Code Styleguide

- Stick to the style of the existing code (e.g., indents, comments, naming conventions).
